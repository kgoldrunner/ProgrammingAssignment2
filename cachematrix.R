##Caching the Mean of a Vector
##The following can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment 
##that is different from the current environment. Below are two functions 
##that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean.


##makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
##set the value of the vector
##get the value of the vector
##set the value of the mean
##get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
        getmean <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmean = setmean,
             getmean = getmean)
}


## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getmean()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- mean(data, ...)
        x$setmean(m)
        m        
}
